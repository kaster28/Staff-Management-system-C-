# Staff-Management-system-C-
A campus staff management system based on MVC model

A C# campus staff management system based on MVC model. The project tends to use LINQ to communicate with the database, uses data binding to each visual element and WPF for interface development..

The user views the staff list when the application first loads or when switching to the staff list view.
This list will display names in the format ‘Family Name, Given Name (Title)’, as in ‘Einstein, Albert (Dr)’, and be ordered alphabetically by family name.
In addition to using the list to access staff details, the user can also filter the list, either by a staff member’s employment category or (if time available in project) partial name match, or both.
For basic filtering, the user is able to list all staff, or just those who are academic, technical, administrative, or casual.
If implementing name matching then the list contents would be restricted to show only those staff whose given name or family name contains the text entered by the user.
Partial matches that span combinations of given and family name do not need to be supported, so look for matches within both names independ.
